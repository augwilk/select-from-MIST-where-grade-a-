## Problem Description:

The task at hand:
Today, college football data is spread across multiple platforms and sources, making it difficult to get a clear and accurate picture of the sport. Since this approach is broken up across platforms, it is difficult to access and analyze key statistics or trends over time. To address this issue, the NCAA has launched a project to create an essential database of Division 1 college football statistics.
Specifically, the project aims to create a unified data repository for all D1 conferences, players, and head coaches, including in-depth statistics such as NIL, wins, losses, and game statistics among others.

## Queries:

1. Query 1 lists the players that have NIL deals with the company Nike along with their cummulative statictics for teh season. The results are ordered from greatest to least stats with priority given to passing yards and then receiving yards.

Query 1 allows managers to see which signed players are perfroming the best. A company like Nike would want to sign with the highest producing atheletes to help build their brand as an elite sporting wear producer. The company may need to consider cutting deals with certain athletes that are nto perfroming well or look into extending contracts with high performing players. This query also reveals areas Nike could continue to grow. For example, Only one player signed with Nike has a significant numebr of rushing yards. This may entice Nike to look into other running backs to sponsor to continue to grow and promote their brand in teh college football landscape. This query could help Sponsors make informed decsions and assess how their contracted players are performing.

2. Query 2 shows which head coach and their team exceeded the average number of wins in the SEC.

Query 2 allows managers to look at statistics for performance benchmarking and rankings within the SEC. This can also be used as a head coach evaluation to see which head coach and their team is exceeding above average with this conference. An athletic director, fro example, who is in charge of hiring and firing coaches may want to review this data to see how their coach is performing relative to other coaches in the conference. This query might help an anthletic department make informed descions on their coach's salary, job security, or future contracts.

3. Query 3
  
4. Query 4 retrieves all players and the team they joined, along with the date they joined, ordered by descending dates.

Query 5 allows managers to look at the statistics for the performance of the offensive players, moving the spotlight away from the QB postion. It can be also used by Head coaches to see who are the best playmakers are in the offence in comparision to other players, which can be valubale in developing different schemes against different teams. For example, it can tell a head coach what player is exceeding compared to other offensive players that aren't neccesarily the QB, and make informed and thorough decision on who the ball should be given to mainly, impacting the performance of the whole offense.
